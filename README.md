# ICG-Drone-Semantic-segmentation
Using fully convolutional models for solving a semantic segmentation task on the Aerial Semantic Segmentation drone dataset.
# Goal
The goal is to assign a label, a numerical value, to each pixel of the image in order to identify sets of pixels that belong to a specific category or class.
